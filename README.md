# LeetGPU

This repository contains the solutions for the **LeetGPU challenges**.
The main objective is learning GPU programming using available languages and framework, but it will be focused in `CUDA`.

---

## Development

For comparing the performance between serial and parallel version, each execution time will be measured - only the time to execute the code - and added here.

Each serial version will be coded using C++ and each parallel version will be coded using CUDA.

---

## Problems

There are 34 challenges in LeetGPU divided into three difficulties:

- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

Each solution we be added here after each attempt.

---

### Easy

- [x] Vector Addition
    - Serial: 843 ms
    - Parallel: 6.74512 ms
- [ ] Matrix Multiplication
    - Serial: TO BE DONE
    - Parallel: TO BE DONE

### Medium
